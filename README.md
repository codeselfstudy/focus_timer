## Install

```
$ npm install
```

## Configure

Copy the file `.env-example` to `.env` and add your Firebase settings there. They don't need to be secret, but Firebase costs money.

## Run

```text
$ npm start
```

## Development

There's a simple generator script to create new components and pages.

Create a component in the `src/components` dir:

```text
$ ./g c form-input
```

Create a page in the `src/pages` dir:

```text
$ ./g p contact
```

Use snake-case.
